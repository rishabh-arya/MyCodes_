All right, we went over a ton of material in the first module. I just want to take a quick moment to recap before we move on. We first began by defining SQL. You should know now that SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and that it's a standard language used to communicate with relational database management systems. Speaking of relational database management systems, you should also know the difference between a transactional and a relational database. We also began to go over them, very important concept of primary keys, foreign keys, and table relationships. Pin that, because we're going to revisit these concepts in a lot more detail later in the course when we start talking about Joins. We also discussed some basic SQL Syntax. And you should now be able to write basic queries statements using SELECT and FROM. Finally, we wrapped up by going over how to write comments in your code. Which are essential to include so that both you and your colleagues can follow what you're doing and try to do in your code. It's a really good habit to get into as you're starting out. So be sure to keep practicing that aspect as you begin to write your first query statements with SQL. In our next module, we're going to go over the methods for sorting, filtering, and paring down your data results. As you've probably seen by now, some data sets contain millions of records, and it would be crazy to try and look at all of them. So this is an important skill to have. I look forward to seeing you there.
