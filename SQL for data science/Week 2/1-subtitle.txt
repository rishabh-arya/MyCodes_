Now that you've began writing your first SQL statements, you're probably really starting to see just how much data you can pull down from databases. So far what you've been experimenting with only has been a few thousand records, but many databases have a lot more data in them. Someday you might work with databases with the millions or even tens of millions of records in it. It almost boggles the mind, right? Well clearly, we're never going to want to look at all of that data at once. So thankfully, SQL gives us several methods to pair down and sort our data so we can quickly get the results we want. That's what we're going to discuss in this module. I'm going to introduce you to several methods for filtering data. At the end of this module, you'll know how to use several more clauses and operators including WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, OR, NOT, LIKE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY. In addition, I'm going to tell you about wildcards which allow us to search for more specific or parts of record, including their disadvantages and advantages, and how we can best use these wildcards. We'll also discuss how to use some basic math operators as well as aggregate functions like, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, and MAX. And we'll start to begin analyzing our data. Obviously, this module's jam packed with new information. So let's not waste any more time, and go ahead and get started.
